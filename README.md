This repository contains the code developed for my Master's thesis: A comparative study on approaches to numerical modelling of fiber-reinforced concrete. 

These pieces of code employ the finite element method implemented with Firedrake to simulate the responses of plain concrete and fiber-reinforced concrete in several different test and use cases. Two constitutive models are used separatly to describe the material behavior, namely the Drucker-Prager model and the cohesive zone model. 

It must be admitted that  the implemented simulations are imperfect due to my deficiency in knowledge and experience, so any comments or revising advice are desirably welcome.
